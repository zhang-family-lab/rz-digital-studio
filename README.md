# RZ Digital Studio — Next.js Preview

This repository has been scaffolded to use Next.js as a lightweight developer experience while serving your existing static `index.html`.

Quick start (Windows):

1. Install Node.js (16+ recommended).
2. From the project root run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 — the root redirects to the static `public/index.html`.

Notes:
- The original `index.html` was copied to `public/index.html` so it is served statically.
- Use `npm run build` and `npm start` for production.
